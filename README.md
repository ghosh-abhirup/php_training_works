PHP projects from basic to advanced
This is my journey repo of learning PHP from basics.
All of my projects are going to be uploaded with the commit on their working

## First week:
  `Basics`  `Setting up XAMPP`  `Working with Apache and MySQL`   `Connecting php app to Database`
## Second week:
  - Day 1: `CRUD OPERATIONS`
  - Day 2: `Working with files`
    - `include`(returns warning which can lead to problems) and `require`(returns error which is good and easy to tackle)
    - readfile()
    - File pointers with fopen. 'r', 'r+', 'w', 'w+', 'a'
    - `fread()` `fwrite()`
    - `fgets()` `fgetc`
  -  Day 3: `Cookies` `Sessions`
  - Project 1: `Login System`
  - Project 2: `Forum in php`
